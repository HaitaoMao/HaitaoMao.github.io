Last day, my first paper is accepted by Neurips2022. Although this is not the first accept paper, but it also means a lot to me. On those busy days, I ask myself a question time after time. What do you want to achieve in those five years PhD life? And finally, here is the list. See what will happen in the five years time. (I will make some conclusion after each year end, and maybe make some new goal.)



About leadership

- Lead a conference workshop 
- Join the Organizing Committee of LoG 
- Become a good host on conference, seminar, and debate
- successfully mentor a student (if possible, lead the team)



About graph community

- Write the book: Deep Learning on Graph

About my research:

- Focus on one or two topics on Graph with a deeper understanding. Go math, go more understanding.
- Have 10 first author papers. It will be 5 one month later. Let's see what will happened then.
- Mentor student and have 10 co-authored paper.
- Have my own master piece. I think now I have 1 or 2, but in different topics. Please have one on Graph.
- Have one strong application background. Now I think it is the financial knowledge Graph. Do not know where to go next. Maybe really deep in machine learning or AI4Science. I will find the answer in these years.
- If fortunately, have more than 1,000 citations.
