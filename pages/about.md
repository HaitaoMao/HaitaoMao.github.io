I am current a final-year undergraduate student of Elite Program, Software Academy at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/).  I have won **The best short paper award in CIKM2021** as the first author (My first paper in the undergraduate year). 

My current research interests lies primarily in understanding the blackbox of DNN especially the mechanism of GNN. Revolving on this ultimate goal, I mainly study the following topics : **Fundamental Research on Deep Learning** (Initialization strategy, Regularization method), **Understanding how to use GNN in different scenarios**. 

My research interests lie primarily in opening the black box of Deep Neuron Network and understanding the mechanism of Graph Neuron Network.

Currently, I am actively particpiate in the **new** AI community: [MLNLP](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IUjQIVCSKexVKuV_jz5SRg) which is organized by my good friends: [Libo Qin]([Libo Qin - Home Page (hit.edu.cn)](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~lbqin/)), Qian Liu, Jianan Zhao, Xiangyu Zhao. Welcome to become a member of our community! Also welcome to my visit my Chinese blog at [Zhihu](https://huanhuqueyue.github.io/MyBlog/[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3XUANDAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) with more than . 



### Selected publication

- [Neuron Campaign for Initialization Guided by Information Bottleneck Theory](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459637.3482153)  
  CIKM2021 **Best Short Paper Award**

### Internship

**Microsoft Research Asia (January, 2021 - October, 2021)**

I was the first post-2000s generation research intern in the [Data Knowledge Intelligent Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) (Used to be called Software Analysis Group) leaded by [Dongmei Zhang]([Dongmei Zhang at Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dongmeiz/)). Fortunately I was guided by Principal Researcher [Qiang Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bwTLZSIAAAAJ), Researcher [Lun Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3XUANDAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), Senior Principal Researcher Manager [Shi Han](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shihan/). And my research topic in MSRA are: initialization strategy, regularization term, Graph Domain Adaptation. 

My achievement in MSRA are:

- Get the star of tomorrow award (top 10% intern)
- Get the CIKM2021 best short paper award as the first author.
- Participate in the KDD CUP2021 to handle large-scale graph and get the rank of $23_{th}$
- Help Jianan Zhao to found our guitar club in MSRA.
