I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University supervised by [Jiliang Tang](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/index.html). And I received my bachelor degree from the Elite Program, Software Academy at [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2022. I have won **the best short paper award in CIKM2021** as the first author.

My current research interests lie primarily in understanding the black box of DNN (forward process) and the causality of a dataset-generating process. **I believe** that all the techniques for solving the generalization problem, such as contrastive learning, meta-learning, and domain generalization, share some similar assumptions on the data generating process. (I think Matrix Factorization can be a good tool for solving the problem.) Revolving on this ultimate goal, I mainly study the following topics: **Causal discovery and o.o.d problem on graph-structured data and ranking data**, **Fundamental Research on Deep Learning**(Initialization strategy, Regularization method, Understanding with an unified view).

I enjoy my life more than research and I am certainly a heavy emotional person with sincerity, which is always thankful to those persons in my life through: relatives, teachers, leaders, precious friends. 
My interests majorly lies in singing (really good at it), long-distance running, playing guitar. I would like to try all kinds of sports in my spare time.

### Recent Activity
I am actively particpiating in a **new** AI community: [MLNLP](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IUjQIVCSKexVKuV_jz5SRg). I am also a hoster in [AITIME](http://www.aitime.cn/). Welcome to my visit my Chinese blog at [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/que-yue-3-77) with more than 1700 followers. New blogs in English are now moved into this website.

- Serve as the committee member to host the 9th seminar of MLNLP community. Looking forward to your participation! [[news]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/EgeR0ZAooS805wvNc5K6Ug)
- I host a PhD debate about the backdoor attack in deep learning. See in [link](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jdtu5vRiMVRaTg1A1y8Ihg) [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qT411g7Cq?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=85bb42770c1036d2fc85b057595f1054). It is happy to see that there are 22,189 persons watching our live discussion online.

### Internship

**Microsoft Research Asia (January, 2021 - November, 2021)**

I was the first post-2000s generation research intern in the [Data Knowledge Intelligent Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) (Used to be called Software Analysis Group) leaded by [Dongmei Zhang]([Dongmei Zhang at Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dongmeiz/)). Fortunately I was guided by Principal Researcher [Qiang Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bwTLZSIAAAAJ), Researcher [Lun Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3XUANDAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and Senior Principal Researcher Manager [Shi Han](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shihan/). And my research topic in MSRA are: initialization strategy, regularization method, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Graph with three paper published.
