I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University (MSU) supervised by Dr. [Jiliang Tang](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/index.html). <font color="red">I am actively seeking industry position starting around May 2025.</font> 
My research interests include Graph Machine Learning, Recommender System, Large Language Model, and Information Retrieval. More Details can be found in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mQguPsi5dnD9vnwu1Fz9DWOG1Sdg8ShQ/view?usp=sharing), [Research Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DycBQkBdTCmZOWh9WHNo6gNrALHmDLfe/view?usp=sharing), and [Talk Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RSfGXJAC11c3wc9Gduqg-SoMJ8qfbh7N/view?usp=sharing). If you know of any relevant openings, I would greatly appreciate your consideration. Thank you! 

**My academic research** focuses on (i) developing **versatile graph models** rooted in network science, to achieve strong generalization and broad downstream graph applicability. (ii) **LLM mechanism analysis** to enhance output reliability.

**During my industry internship**, I learn about the **recommender system** in [Snap](https://research.snap.com/team/user-modeling-and-personalization.html), the **search engine** in [Baidu](https://searchscience.baidu.com/), and **tabular data intelligence** in [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/). During these internships, I (i) **transformed industry problems** into research challenges and organized WSDM CUP 2022 and KDD CUP 2023 accordingly (ii) **developed resource-efficient solutions** by identifying and leveraging relationships among data. My intern projects won CIKM 2021 Best Short Paper and WSDM 2024 Best Paper Honorable Mention. 

Moreover, I was engaged in **academic-industry collaborations** between MSU and several companies, including [Graph Mining team, Google Research](https://research.google/teams/graph-mining/),  [Query Understanding team, Amazon](https://amazonsearchqu.github.io/), [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html), [J.P. Morgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence). I **led the [graph research subgroup](https://dse-gfm.github.io/)** in my PhD lab, where I made my best memory collaborating closely with my talented labmates sharing the same goal. I am now serving as the **outreach chair of the [Learning on Graph Conference 2024](https://logconference.org/)**, an exciting new conference facilitating graph and geometry community engagement.
