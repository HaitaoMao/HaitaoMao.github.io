**Do the significant research that nobody do if I do not!**

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Michigan State University supervised by Dr. [Jiliang Tang](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/index.html). And I received my bachelor degree from the Elite Program, Software Academy at [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2022. I have won **the best short paper award in CIKM2021** as the first author.

#### I am a researcher
My research interest is very simple on following two aspective:

- find and solve new practical data mining challanges
- solve the foundamental challenge from optimization perspective.  **A strong perception drives me to believe that many solutions can be attributed to inductive bias in optimization (Forward & Backward).** The algorithm should have the following properties: 
  - Explanable: try to understand the training dynamics of neural network and what inductive biases model tries to induce. 
  - Effective: (1) strong expressive ability power. (2) Introduce inductive bias easily.
  - Efficient: Simple model which the time and memory complexity for the train and inference could be small.
  - Theoretical guarantee: it should be a beautiful theory with its killer application.



For the new practical challenge in data mining, I try my best to propose and solve the industry problem during my internship. My achievements are as follows:

- Unbiased Learning to Rank (found in Baidu)
  - Propose new dataset with new challenges (NeurIPS2022 dataset Track)
  - Host a competition on the Unbiased Learning & pretraining (WSDM CUP 2023)
  - Propose a new scenario: **whole-page Unbiased Learning to Rank** with the first solution (Under review)
- Privacy on Graph (found in Microsoft)
  - Propose a new scenario: **Source Free Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation** with the first solution (Under review)
- Finanical Knowledge Graph:  (found in Warton Research Data Services, ongoing project))
  - Propose how to transfer information from 10Q and 10K financial report into A machine-readable Database.
  - Extract the information to conduct Knowledge Graph from he financial report.
- Multiple regional Session Recommendation (with Amazon, ongoing project) 



For solving the foundamental challenge from optimization perspective, I specifically focus on GNN. I always believe that GNN is not suitable for all tasks and may not be well-optimized. But we can gain much insight and understanding from it. For example, GNN can be view as the optimization procedure for some **energy function** with more insights. My achievements are as follows:

- Understand and enhance general DNN optimization
  - Propose an Initialization strategy with Neuron Compaign (**Won the CIKM2021 Best Short Paper**)
  - Propose a regularization term with understanding on how neuron response to different inputs. (NeurIPS 2022)
- Understand and enhance how to learning on graph
  - Understanding GNN as the multiview Learning. (Under review)
  - Understanding GNN as an energy function. 
- Introduce GNN to more people, especially those in AI4science society.
  - Write the GNN and causal discovery part of AI4Science101 documents. [homepage](https://ai4science101.deepmodeling.com/en/latest/index.html)
  - My course: Encouraging Graph Neural Network. [homepage](https://haitaomao.github.io/Encouraging-Graph-Neural-Network/) (Definitely, I will continue to do it. However, it is too too too busy recently. I will restart in the next vacation.)

I also have a big dream on my research. **I believe** that all the techniques for solving the generalization problem, such as contrastive learning, meta-learning, and domain generalization, share some similar assumptions on the data generating process. (I think Matrix Factorization can be a good tool for solving the problem.)


#### I am a life lover
I am a I enjoy my life research and I am certainly a heavy emotional person with sincerity, which is always thankful to those persons in my life through: relatives, teachers, leaders, precious friends. 
My interests lies in singing (really good at it), long-distance running (3000m in 11 mins), playing guitar. I would die if there is one day without music. And I keep running and meditation every to keep health. That indeed helps.

#### I am a lecturer & community builder
From junior high school, I really enjoy teaching other students and doing presentations though I am still not good at it. I am always practice to becomes a good lecturer. Revolving on this goal: 

I start up a new course called [Encouraging Graph Neural Network](https://haitaomao.github.io/Encouraging-Graph-Neural-Network/). (Definitely, I will continue to do it. However, it is too too too busy recently. I will restart in the next vacation.) The course aims to bridge the gap between the brief introduction and the newest advanced semaniar. It provides history on the related works on GNN and more foundation concepts.

I am a host in [MLNLP](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IUjQIVCSKexVKuV_jz5SRg) and [AITIME](http://www.aitime.cn/).
I have hosted talks with more than 15w as follows:

      I love this work for it opens great opportunity in ULTR domain, a very practical but less study domain.  It open multiple new directions in ULTR: pretrain, multi-task learning, user behavir analysis, causal discovery, long tail analysis. It is 20 times bigger than the existing ULTR datasets. <br>
      We are holding WSDM CUP with this dataset now!
