来小毛给他整个🔥，草！走！忽略 ጿ ኈ ቼ ዽ ጿ

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Michigan State University supervised by Dr. [Jiliang Tang](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/index.html). And I received my bachelor degree from the Elite Program, Software Academy at [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2022. I have won **the best short paper award in CIKM2021** as the first author.



My research is  (1) using toy examples, (2) building  suitable assumption (3) conducting real-world experimental insights (4) deriving theoritical understanding aligning with real-world scenario. With those analysis, I can (1) understand graph-related task, datasets,  model architecture design,  and the learning procedure (2) find new real-world challnge and define research scenario revolving on real-world challenge. (3) Find new solution based on those insights. Details on my research taste can be found at [here](). Feel free to discuss with me for collaboration. 

- The principle on DNN learning procedure: a novel neuron perspective:
  -  Neuron Compaign Initialization strategy (**Won the CIKM2021 Best Short Paper**) 
  - Neuron steadiness regularization (**NeurIPS 2022**)
- The principle on Graph-tasks: (**Theoretical inspire** and **Practice first**)
  - Node classification: Can GNN benefits all nodes iin the same graph? (under-review)
  - Link Prediction: What is the key factors for GNN success in Link prediction? (Ongoing)
- Define new scenairo with real-world challenge
  - Source-free graph Adaptation scenario (Found in Microsoft) (under-review)
  - Homophily-related Graph OOD scenario (under-review)
  - Whole-page Unbiased Learning to Rank (Found in Baidu) (WSDM CUP2023, NeurIPS 2022, under-review)
  - Multi-regional Session Recommendation (Found in Amazon) (KDD-CUP 2023, under-review)
  - Graph application in Finance (Found in Wharton Research Data Service) (under-review)
  - GPT on Graph (under-review)

I still have a big dream on my research. I believe I could build explanable, effective, effective models for the real-world application with first principle.
