I am current a final-year undergraduate student of Elite Program, Software Academy at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). 
I come from the Northeast of China, Heilongjiang, Daqing.
I have won **The best short paper award in CIKM2021** as the first author. I am also an incoming PhD student of Michigan State University supervised by [Jiliang Tang](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/index.html) 

My current research interests lies primarily in understanding the blackbox of DNN (Forward process) and the causallity on dataset. Revolving on this ultimate goal, I mainly study the following topics : **Causal discovery on graph-structured data and ranking data**, **Fundamental Research on Deep Learning** (Initialization strategy, Regularization method, Understanding with unify a view). 

Currently, I am actively particpiating in a **new** AI community: [MLNLP](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IUjQIVCSKexVKuV_jz5SRg). I am also a hoster in AITIME organized by Tsinghua University. Welcome to my visit my Chinese blog at [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/que-yue-3-77) with more than 1700 followers.

### Internship

**Microsoft Research Asia (January, 2021 - November, 2021)**

I was the first post-2000s generation research intern in the [Data Knowledge Intelligent Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) (Used to be called Software Analysis Group) leaded by [Dongmei Zhang]([Dongmei Zhang at Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dongmeiz/)). Fortunately I was guided by Principal Researcher [Qiang Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bwTLZSIAAAAJ), Researcher [Lun Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3XUANDAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and Senior Principal Researcher Manager [Shi Han](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shihan/). And my research topic in MSRA are: initialization strategy, regularization method, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Graph. 

My achievement in MSRA are:

- Get the star of tomorrow award (top 10% intern)
- Get the CIKM2021 best short paper award as the first author.
- Participate in the KDD CUP2021 to handle large-scale graph and get the rank of 23th
- Help Jianan Zhao to found our guitar club in MSRA.

**Baidu (March, 2022 - now)**

I am now a research intern in search strategy department in Baidu supervised by [Lixin Zou](https://www.zoulixin.site/). Now my research topic revolves on debias problem on learning to rank.
