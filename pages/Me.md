I am current a final-year undergraduate student of Elite Program, Software Academy at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). I have won **The best short paper award in CIKM2021** as the first author (My first paper in the undergraduate year). 

My current research interests lies primarily in understanding the blackbox of DNN especially the mechanism of GNN. Revolving on this ultimate goal, I mainly study the following topics : **Adaptative learning on graph-structured data**, **Fundamental Research on Deep Learning** (Initialization strategy, Regularization method), **Financial Knowledge Graph**. 

Currently, I am actively particpiating in a **new** AI community: [MLNLP](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/IUjQIVCSKexVKuV_jz5SRg) which is organized by my good friends: Libo Qin, Qian Liu, Jianan Zhao, Xiangyu Zhao. Welcome to become a member of our community! Also welcome to my visit my Chinese blog at [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/que-yue-3-77) with more than 1600 followers.

### Internship

**Microsoft Research Asia (January, 2021 - November, 2021)**

I was the first post-2000s generation research intern in the [Data Knowledge Intelligent Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) (Used to be called Software Analysis Group) leaded by [Dongmei Zhang]([Dongmei Zhang at Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dongmeiz/)). Fortunately I was guided by Principal Researcher [Qiang Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bwTLZSIAAAAJ), Researcher [Lun Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3XUANDAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and Senior Principal Researcher Manager [Shi Han](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shihan/). And my research topic in MSRA are: initialization strategy, regularization method, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Graph. 

My achievement in MSRA are:

- Get the star of tomorrow award (top 10% intern)
- Get the CIKM2021 best short paper award as the first author.
- Participate in the KDD CUP2021 to handle large-scale graph and get the rank of 23th
- Help Jianan Zhao to found our guitar club in MSRA.
