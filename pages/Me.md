I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Michigan State University supervised by Dr. [Jiliang Tang](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/index.html). And I received my bachelor degree from the Elite Program, Software Academy at [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2022. I have won **the best short paper award in CIKM2021** as the first author.

My current research interests lie primarily in understanding the black box of DNN (forward process) and the causality of a dataset-generating process. **I believe** that all the techniques for solving the generalization problem, such as contrastive learning, meta-learning, and domain generalization, share some similar assumptions on the data generating process. (I think Matrix Factorization can be a good tool for solving the problem.) Revolving on this ultimate goal, I mainly study the following topics: **Causal discovery and o.o.d problem on graph-structured data and ranking data**, **Fundamental Research on Deep Learning**(Initialization strategy, Regularization method, Understanding with an unified view).

I enjoy my life more than research and I am certainly a heavy emotional person with sincerity, which is always thankful to those persons in my life through: relatives, teachers, leaders, precious friends. 
My interests majorly lies in singing (really good at it), long-distance running, playing guitar. I would like to try all kinds of sports in my spare time.

### Course
Encouraged by some of my good friends, I would like to provide my effor to change the Graph Community. I actively start up a new course called [Encouraging Graph Neural Network](https://huanhuqueyue.github.io/Encouraging-Graph-Neural-Network/). The course aims to bridge the gap between the brief introduction and the newest advanced semaniar. It provides history on the related works on GNN and more foundation concepts.

        I love this work become the idea is easy and interesting and provide a new perspective, the inspiration comes from the Lottery Ticket theory and Information Bottleneck theory. <br>

      I love this work for it opens great opportunity in ULTR domain, a very practical but less study domain.  It open multiple new directions in ULTR: pretrain, multi-task learning, user behavir analysis, causal discovery, long tail analysis. It is 20 times bigger than the existing ULTR datasets. <br>
      The follow up is incoming soon!

### Internship

**Microsoft Research Asia (January, 2021 - November, 2021)**

I was the first post-2000s generation research intern in the [Data Knowledge Intelligent Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) (Used to be called Software Analysis Group) leaded by [Dongmei Zhang]([Dongmei Zhang at Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dongmeiz/)). Fortunately I was guided by Principal Researcher [Qiang Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bwTLZSIAAAAJ), Researcher [Lun Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3XUANDAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and Senior Principal Researcher Manager [Shi Han](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shihan/). And my research topic in MSRA are: initialization strategy, regularization method, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Graph with three paper published. 

My achievement in MSRA are:

- Get the star of tomorrow award (top 10% intern)
- Get the CIKM2021 best short paper award as the first author.
- One paper about regularization term accepted by Neurips2022 as the co-first author and first student author.
